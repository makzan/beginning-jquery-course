Here are the options of development environments:



<ul>
<li>Local development in Mac</li>
<li>Local development in Linux</li>
<li>Local development in Windows</li>
<li>Cloud development with Cloud9</li>
<li>Cloud development with Nitrous.io</li>
</ul>


In my examples, I would use <a href="https://c9.io">Cloud9</a> with SQLite by default. But you should be able to run the example code in your own local development. And with a small tweak, you can run the code with different database engines, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

<a href="http://InstallRails.com">InstallRails.com</a> provides detail guide to install Ruby on Rails for Windows, Linux and Mac. The guide also installs SQLite and Git version control tool.
