title: Welcome to Ruby on Rails course
---

Hi Ruby on Rails student,

I’m Thomas Mak. In the coming month, I’ll share my Ruby on Rails development experience and tips with you.

I published the lecture notes on the following website. Besides Ruby on Rails course, you can also find my other lecture notes there. They are all web-related. I’d suggest you join the membership there. By joining as membership, you can chat with me through the on-site chat.

<a href="https://ModernWeb.Design">https://ModernWeb.Design</a>

The course contains 8 sessions. In each session, we run a 2 hours lecture and 1 hour lab exercise.

During the lecture, we learn essential concepts to use the Rails framework. We learn different tips and tricks by working on the example projects. You can learn via the written text, videos and learn with me through chatting.

After each lecture, we have exercise time. We want you to complete the lab exercise. We will mark your score based on the marking scheme provided in each exercise.

After thou course, we will go through 3 example of building web applications:



<ol>
<li>A blog with posts and comments</li>
<li>A link redirect service</li>
<li>A customer management tool</li>
</ol>


If you have any questions during the class or after the course, please feel free to ask me through the website chat or email (mak@makzan.net)

Best Regards,
Thomas Mak
