123.next                                  # 124
[1, 2, 3].count                           # 3
[1, 2, 3] * 2                             # [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3].reverse                         # [3, 2, 1]
variable_name = 30                        # 30
puts "There are #{variable_name} cars."   # There are 30 cars.
