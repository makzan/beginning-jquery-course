title: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

We often say "Don't re-invent the wheel", or DRY (Don't repeat yourself)

In Rails community, there are many gems (plugins) that help achieving common and essential features in web applications. For example, there are Devise gem for user authentication, Paperclip gem for file uploading. When the plugins in market is good enough, we don't need to create our own code. These plugins often provide customizations to fit into different projects.

We would like to put the efforts on making the most important part of the rails application, not on re-inventing what others have done for us.
